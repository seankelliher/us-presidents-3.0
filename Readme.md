## Reflection

I wanted to build a component that allows users to sort Presidents by demographic traits such as birthplace, political party, age, marital status, previous work experience, length of term, and reason for departure. Challenges were building so users could filter by both categories and sub-categories while keeping the page as uncluttered as possible. This required building multiple sub-navigations that would display or disappear depending on which category was selected. The category and sub-category approach allows users to see, for example, the age of all Presidents and then filter out only those inaugurated in, say, their forties.
